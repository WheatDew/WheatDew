The “Building Fire” effects are not complete in terms of lighting and sound setup. In many cases it makes the most sense to use a few of the effects together, such as a floor fire and a wall fire mixed with a smoke cloud. Because individual effects would likely be clustered, it is up to you to setup the sound effects and lighting. This is simply to avoid too many lights or audio sources being clustered in the same scene.
